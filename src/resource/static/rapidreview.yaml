  title: 'Identifying Software Process Line Evolution Lessons from Software Product Line Evidence: A Tertiary Study'
  abstract: Defining a software process is a complex activity, especially from scratch. In this scenario, different process reuse techniques have been proposed to reduce the effort, as well as increase the quality of the defined process, such as Software Process Line (SPrL). SPrL provides a systematic way to support software process reuse. However, SPrL is not being widely used in industry yet, mainly due to the lack of support, e.g., SPrL evolution support (maintenance, improvement, tailoring). Unfortunately, there is no specific literature about evolution support in the context of SPrL. Thus, aware of the similarity between the SPrL and Software Product Line (SPL) techniques, this paper aims to identify SPrL evolution lessons (e.g., challenges, enabling technologies) from SPL evidence through a tertiary study.
